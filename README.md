Hello Everyone; 
About the testing the project openMRS, you should do the following first
then start merging your codes here with mine. 

1-	Come together with your group friends (everyday- if possible)
2-	Add everyone’s emails to one’s Jira account (you can use that account as a group Jira account)
3-	Start entering all the user stories to the Jira on Product Backlog
4-	First do have your grooming meeting and make sure that all the user stories are clear and prioritized. 
5-	After you done your grooming meeting move your user stories to the sprint backlog
6-	Start doing your Sprint Planning meeting and make sure that all user stories are estimated and make sure that your team capacity form ready. Assign each user story to one person for testing.
7-	After you done your Sprint planning meeting start your sprint. 
8-	Now you have Jira board with to-do, in progress, and done column. And all your tickets are in to-do column. 
9-	Start test execution manually and automated. After you done testing manually and completed codes in IntelliJ create your reports by completing RTM form. 
10-	If you find any bug you should create bug ticket in Jira and fill up the bug description form. 
11-	When you start coding your test cases always merge your part with your friends’ codes on GitHub. Your final project must be completed in GitHub.
